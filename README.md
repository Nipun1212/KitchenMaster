## Overview

KitchenMaster is a mobile application developed as part of a software engineering module. The idea behind KitchenMaster arose from the lack of available solutions in the market that provided food recommendations tailored to individual users. Previously, users had to manually search for recipes, assess their available ingredients, and determine what they could cook.

This app streamlines the process by utilizing the user's current inventory to suggest various recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. This way, users can make the most of what they have and enjoy a variety of delicious meals.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Users can input their available ingredients either through a custom image recognition model developed by our team, or manually through the items page.
- **Recipe Recommendations**: The app recommends recipes based on the user's inventory.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark recipes they like and store them in the favorites page for easy reference.
- **Ingredient Reminder**: Set reminders to restock ingredients that you are running low on.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter recipes based on dietary preferences such as vegetarian, vegan, halal, and more.
